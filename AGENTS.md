# Pulumi Agent Skills

This repository contains official Pulumi agent skills for infrastructure as code workflows.

## Repository Structure

Skills are organized into two plugin groups:

### Migration Plugin (`migration/`)

Skills for converting and importing infrastructure from other tools to Pulumi:

- **pulumi-terraform-to-pulumi**: Migrate Terraform projects to Pulumi
- **pulumi-cdk-to-pulumi**: Migrate AWS CDK applications to Pulumi
- **cloudformation-to-pulumi**: Migrate AWS CloudFormation stacks/templates to Pulumi
- **pulumi-arm-to-pulumi**: Migrate Azure ARM templates and Bicep to Pulumi

### Authoring Plugin (`authoring/`)

Skills for writing quality Pulumi programs, components, automation, and secrets management:

- **pulumi-best-practices**: Best practices for writing reliable Pulumi programs
- **pulumi-component**: Guide for authoring ComponentResource classes
- **pulumi-automation-api**: Best practices for using Pulumi Automation API
- **pulumi-esc**: Guidance for working with Pulumi ESC (Environments, Secrets, and Configuration)

## Installation

### Claude Code Plugin System

```bash
/plugin marketplace add pulumi/agent-skills
/plugin install pulumi-migration
/plugin install pulumi-authoring
```

### Universal (all agents)

Install all skills:

```bash
npx skills add pulumi/agent-skills
```

Or install individual plugin groups:

```bash
npx skills add pulumi/agent-skills/migration      # 4 migration skills
npx skills add pulumi/agent-skills/authoring      # 4 authoring skills
```

This works with Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Codex, and other agent tools.

## Skill Writing Conventions

### Skill Name Format

Skill names follow the pattern: `pulumi-<feature>`.

### Trigger Phrases

Skill descriptions should include keywords and phrases that trigger automatic activation. Use "MUST be loaded when" or "Use when" to clarify activation criteria.

Example:
```yaml
description: Convert an AWS CDK application to Pulumi. This skill MUST be loaded whenever a user requests migration or conversion of a CDK application to Pulumi.
```

### Progressive Disclosure

Keep the main SKILL.md file focused and concise (under 500 lines recommended). For detailed reference material, add additional markdown files in the skill directory with meaningful names.

Example structure:
```
pulumi-cdk-to-pulumi/
├── SKILL.md              # Main skill file
├── cdk-convert.md        # Reference: cdk2pulumi tool usage
├── cdk-importer.md       # Reference: cdk-importer tool usage
└── cloudformation-id-lookup.md  # Reference: import ID lookup
```

Reference these files from the main SKILL.md using relative links:
```markdown
For detailed tool usage, see [cdk-convert.md](cdk-convert.md).
```

### Cross-Skill References

When one skill references another, use the pattern: `Use skill <skill-name>`.

Example:
- "Use skill `pulumi-component` for in-depth component authoring guidance"

## Adding a New Skill

1. Determine which plugin group the skill belongs to (migration or authoring)
2. Create the skill directory: `<plugin>/skills/<skill-name>/`
3. Write the `SKILL.md` file with proper frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: skill-name
   description: Clear description with activation triggers
   ---
   ```
4. Update this AGENTS.md file to list the new skill in the appropriate plugin section
5. Update [README.md](README.md) to add the skill to the skills table
6. Submit a pull request

The skill will automatically be included in its plugin group. No manifest updates are needed.

## Creating a New Plugin Group

1. Create the plugin directory structure:
   ```
   <plugin-name>/
   ├── .claude-plugin/
   │   └── plugin.json
   └── skills/
   ```

2. Create `plugin.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "pulumi-<plugin-name>",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "description": "Plugin description",
     "author": { "name": "Pulumi", "url": "https://github.com/pulumi" },
     "homepage": "https://www.pulumi.com/docs/",
     "repository": "https://github.com/pulumi/agent-skills",
     "license": "Apache-2.0",
     "keywords": ["pulumi", "..."]
   }
   ```

3. Add an entry to [.claude-plugin/marketplace.json](.claude-plugin/marketplace.json):
   ```json
   {
     "name": "pulumi-<plugin-name>",
     "source": "./<plugin-name>",
     "description": "Plugin description",
     "category": "appropriate-category"
   }
   ```

4. Add skills to `<plugin-name>/skills/`
5. Update this AGENTS.md and README.md
6. Submit a pull request
